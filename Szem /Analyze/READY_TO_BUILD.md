# 🎯 Ready to Build: Norbi0N_Farming Module

## ✅ What I've Prepared

I've analyzed SZEM's architecture and created:

1. **📋 Architecture Design** - Complete integration plan
2. **💀 Module Skeleton** - Ready-to-customize code structure
3. **🔗 Coordination System** - Smart pause logic with other modules

---

## 🚀 What I Can Build For You

### **Complete Module Including:**

✅ **3rd Party Script Integration**
- Load your farming script automatically
- Configure it programmatically
- Monitor execution
- Collect results

✅ **Smart Coordination**
- Pause when Builder is working
- Pause when old Farm is active
- Pause when Scavenger is running
- Resume when clear

✅ **Village Management**
- Select which villages to farm from
- Track last run time per village
- Cycle through villages automatically
- Sort/filter/search villages

✅ **Professional UI**
- Settings panel
- Village list (like Gyűjtő)
- Pause/Start button
- Statistics display

✅ **Data Persistence**
- Auto-save settings
- Save village states
- Restore on reload

✅ **Error Handling**
- Retry logic
- Error logging
- Recovery system

✅ **Integration**
- Works with existing modules
- Follows SZEM patterns
- Uses worker system
- Bot protection ready

## 📝 What I Need From You

To build this perfectly, tell me:

### **About Your 3rd Party Script:**

1. **📍 Script Location:**
   - URL? (e.g., https://github.com/you/script.js)
   - Or should I help you create it?

2. **🎮 How It Works:**
   - What does the script do?
   - Template-based farming?
   - AI selection?
   - List-based targets?

3. **🔧 Configuration:**
   - How to configure it?
   - JavaScript object? Form inputs?
   - What settings does it have?

4. **▶️ How to Start:**
   - Click a button?
   - Call a function?
   - Automatically starts?

5. **✅ How to Know It's Done:**
   - DOM element appears/disappears?
   - Variable changes?
   - Time-based (e.g., runs for 30 seconds)?
   - Callback function?

6. **📊 Results:**
   - Does it provide statistics?
   - Attack count? Resources gained?
   - How to read the results?

## 🎯 My Recommendations

### **Option A: You Have the Script Already**
→ Send me:
- Script URL or code
- DOM selectors it uses
- How to control it

→ I'll integrate it in ~30 minutes

### **Option B: You Need the Script Created**
→ Tell me:
- Your farming strategy
- What targets to hit
- What units to use
- Any special logic

→ I'll create BOTH:
- The 3rd party farming script
- The SZEM integration module

### **Option C: Reference Your Norbi0N_Master**

I see you have:
```
/Norbi0N_Master/Norbi0N_Master.user.js (1582 lines)
/Norbi0N_Master/Farming_Module.ueser.js (935 lines)
```

→ Should I:
- Adapt your existing Farming_Module?
- Create integration layer for it?
- Use it as reference for new script?

## 💡 Quick Example - How It Would Work

```
USER:
1. Adds villages: 123|456, 789|012
2. Enters script URL: https://your-script.js
3. Configures coordination: ☑️ Pause if Builder active
4. Clicks ▶️ Start

SZEM:
1. Loads your script in village 123|456
2. Configures script with your settings
3. Starts farming
4. Monitors until done
5. Moves to village 789|012
6. Repeat
7. If Builder starts → Pauses farming
8. When Builder done → Resumes farming
```

## ⚡ What Happens Next

**Tell me your choice:**

**A)** "I have a farming script at [URL], here's how it works..."  
→ I'll integrate it TODAY

**B)** "I need you to create the farming script, here's my strategy..."  
→ I'll build everything

**C)** "Look at my Norbi0N_Master/Farming_Module.ueser.js and adapt it"  
→ I'll analyze and integrate

**D)** "Let me think about the strategy first"  
→ I'll wait for your design, no problem!

## 🎨 Vision

**End Result:**

```
SZEM Menu:
├── FARMOLÓ (Classic SZEM farming)
├── NORBI0N_FARMING (Your advanced method) ← NEW!
├── JELENTÉS ELEMZŐ
├── ÉPÍTŐ
├── GYŰJTŐ
└── ADATMENTŐ

User can:
✅ Run BOTH farming methods (different villages)
✅ OR choose ONE method (disable the other)
✅ OR switch between them anytime
✅ Everything coordinates automatically
```

**I'm ready! What's your choice? A, B, C, or D?** 🚀
